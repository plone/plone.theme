Changelog
=========

2.0b1 - 2010-01-02
------------------

- Fix an error introduced by my previous adjustment. If a skin layer
  extending the default layer was used (which is typical), then the
  default layer would end up with higher precedence than browser
  layers not extending the default layer.

2.0a2 - 2009-11-13
------------------

- Inherit from the CMFDefault layer again, for compatibility with products
  that depend only on CMF but are also usable within Plone, and register
  views to the CMFDefault layer.
  [davisagli]

2.0a1 - 2009-04-05
------------------

- Avoid inheriting from the CMFDefault browser layer and rather define our
  own. We don't have anything in common with the CMFDefault layer.
